## Security Updates (2024-07-20)

### Fixed Issues

#### Issue #17: Private Key Handling in Solana Contract
- **File**: `blockchain/onchain/smartcontract/solana_contract/mod.rs`
- **Problem**: Insecure private key handling in the `execute_transfer_transaction` function.
- **Fix**:
  - Created a secure `SecretKey` struct with memory zeroing capabilities
  - Implemented `Drop` trait to automatically wipe sensitive data from memory
  - Added randomized overwriting before zeroing memory
  - Refactored the transaction execution flow to minimize key exposure time
  - Created scoped contexts to ensure keypairs are dropped as soon as possible
  - Maintained backward compatibility while encouraging use of the secure API

#### Issue #21: Nonce Control in bridgeToNear
- **File**: `blockchain/onchain/smartcontract/dmd_bsc_contract.sol`
- **Problem**: Inadequate nonce management in the bridge between ERC1155 and ERC20 tokens.
- **Fix**:
  - Added comprehensive `BridgeRequest` struct for better transaction tracking
  - Implemented strict nonce validation across chains with `_usedRemoteNonces`
  - Added transaction sequencing with `_outgoingSequence` and `_lastIncomingSequence`
  - Enhanced error handling with better logging and diagnostic information
  - Improved the refund mechanism for failed transactions
  - Added support for out-of-order messages with sequencing window
  - Created query functions for bridge state monitoring

## Project Structure

- `blockchain/onchain/`: Smart contracts and blockchain-specific code
  - `brigde/`: Bridge implementations for cross-chain functionality
  - `smartcontract/`: Smart contracts for various blockchains
    - `dmd_bsc_contract.sol`: Binance Smart Chain contract
    - `solana_contract/`: Solana-specific implementation
    - `near_contract/`: NEAR blockchain implementation
- `wallet/`: Wallet implementation with secure key management
- `common/`: Shared utilities and libraries
- `network/`: Networking and communication components

## Security Features

The project implements several security best practices:

1. **Secure Key Management**: Private keys are handled securely with zero-knowledge approaches.
2. **Nonce Protection**: Comprehensive nonce tracking to prevent replay attacks.
3. **Cross-Chain Security**: Validation of messages across blockchain bridges.
4. **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling with automatic recovery mechanisms.
5. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against transaction flooding attacks.

## Development Guidelines

When making changes to the codebase, please ensure:

1. All security-related fixes adhere to the established patterns
2. New cryptographic implementations are properly reviewed
3. Bridge operations maintain proper sequence and validation
4. Error handling follows the established recovery patterns
5. Updates to the `.bugs` file to track resolved issues

## Bug Tracking

The `.bugs` file contains a comprehensive list of identified issues and their resolution status.
Please reference this file when working on fixes to avoid duplicate efforts and to ensure
consistent documentation of security improvements.
