# SnipeBot TradeLogic Professional Upgrade Roadmap

## 1. Modular Architecture & Trait-based Design
- [ ] Refactor all trading logic into clear modules: smart_trade, mev_logic, manual_trade, common/types
- [ ] Ensure all strategies implement trait-based interfaces (MevBot, TradeExecutor, CrossDomainBridge...)
- [ ] Separate config, types, and execution logic for each strategy

## 2. MEV & Advanced Strategies
- [ ] Expand MEV logic: Arbitrage, Sandwich, JIT Liquidity, Cross-domain, Liquidation, Order Flow Auction
- [ ] Implement JIT Liquidity detection and execution (Uniswap V3, Balancer...)
- [ ] Add cross-domain arbitrage (multi-chain price, bridge cost/time, risk)
- [ ] Integrate liquidation detection for lending protocols (Aave, Compound...)
- [ ] Add order flow auction and backrunning pipeline

## 3. Risk Management & Behavior Analysis
- [ ] Standardize risk_score calculation for all opportunities (profit, liquidity, time, bridging, incentive...)
- [ ] Add config for max risk, min profit, capital allocation, whitelist/blacklist
- [ ] Integrate trader behavior analysis (MEV, whale, arbitrageur, retail...)
- [ ] Predict and avoid front-run, sandwich, and high-risk patterns

## 4. Config, Async, Logging, Testing
- [ ] Refactor all configs to have Default, clear doc, and easy extension
- [ ] Ensure all state is thread-safe (tokio::sync::RwLock/Mutex, Send+Sync+'static)
- [ ] Add detailed logging for all error paths, no unwrap/expect
- [ ] Add unit/integration tests for all critical logic

## 5. Documentation & Code Quality
- [ ] Add/complete doc comment for all public trait/struct/function (English)
- [ ] Follow import/type annotation/order conventions strictly
- [ ] Regularly run clippy, fmt, and static analysis

## 6. Extensibility & User Customization
- [ ] Allow user to enable/disable each strategy via config
- [ ] Design plugin system for custom strategies
- [ ] Document how to add new strategy module

## 7. References & Inspiration
- [ ] Study and adapt ideas from: Flashbots, Rook, CowSwap, Hummingbot, open-source DeFi bots
